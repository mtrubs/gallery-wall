He also made designs for civic uniforms, for money and official seals and even produced two crudely drawn and vulgar caricatures that mocked the English. Since the Revolution his views on the English had clearly changed and he no longer felt them to be the epitome of a free nation. According to the print's caption the English government 'is personified by the figure of a Devil skinned alive, monopolizing commerce and covered with all the Royal decorations. The portrait of the king is located at the rear end of the government which vomits on its people a myriad of taxes which overwhelm them.'"

Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael is the most prominent and innovative representative of the landscape genre in the Dutch school during the second half of the 17th century. Since the beginning of the century a number of masters in Holland had shown an interest in capturing the different nuances of light and in depicting cloudy skies, granting nature a poetic quality and taking the genre to new heights. Ruisdael began to paint at a very early age with his father and his uncle, who were also well known for their landscapes. In 1649 he was accepted as a master in the guild of painters of Haarlem, and in 1657 he moved to Amsterdam, where he remained for the rest of his life."

    "about": "The Three Trees is Rembrandt's largest and most striking etched landscape. Here he masterfully combined techniques (drypoint, engraving, varied depths of etched lines, and a speckled tone) to create a sense of nature in flux. He animated the landscape with many details: an artist sketching on the hill at right, a fisher couple at lower left, and an amorous couple hidden in the darkened foreground bushes. Some of the unnatural cloud formations left of center indicate that Rembrandt may have etched The Three Trees on a plate that contained an abandoned sketch for The Death of the Virgin, a composition he continued on a larger plate in 1639."
